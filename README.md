1) What is the difference between var, let, and const?
Ans: let and const are block scoped. Var is function scoped. Var allows reassignment. Const variables can't be reassigned. Let variables can be reassigned but no redeclared. 


2) What is the difference between map(), forEach(), and filter()?
Ans: The Map() function returns a new array that does some sort of operation on the elements of the original array and filter() also returns an array based on conditions that we define. The forEach() function returns undefined and is used when we don't need a new array to be returned. 


3) What are arrow functions in ES6?
Ans: Arrow functions are functions that has simplified and shorter syntax. They are represented with an arrow '=>'. Arrow functions also have characteristics  which include, if there is one parameter we don't need to use a parenthesis and if we have curly braces then we use a return statement to return a value.


4) How does destructuring assignment work in ES6?
Ans: Destructuring assignment allows us to easily access values from arrays and objects. For arrays we can assign variables based on position and for objects
we can assign variables based on property names.



5) Explain template literals in ES6. How are they different from string concatenation?
Ans: Template literals in ES6 allow us to create strings using a back tick and they are powerful as they allow expressions to be embedded in strings instead of needing to concatenate strings. The "\n" operator is also not required to write multiple lines.
